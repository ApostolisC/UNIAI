This is the updated website of UniAI, built in Next.js

## Getting Started
First, clone the repository on your machine.

Then, in order to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Command should run inside the cloned folder

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Any new updates in the code files will result in auto-updates of the server, so there is no need to restart the server.
